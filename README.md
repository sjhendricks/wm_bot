# wm_bot

> A retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) chatbot for answering questions about William & Mary, powered by a 3-stage hybrid retrieval pipeline (FAISS + BM25 + CrossEncoder reranking) and a QLoRA fine-tuned LLM (Llama 3, Gemma, or Mistral) served via a Gradio UI.

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/sjhendricks/wm_bot

--- 

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to collect and organize information from William & Mary websites to build a system that answers questions about William & Mary.

We scrape relevant webpages, extract clean text, and store results in a structured format used for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). A 3-stage hybrid retrieval system (FAISS → BM25 → CrossEncoder reranking) fetches the most relevant passages, which are passed as context to a QLoRA fine-tuned LLM to generate grounded answers via a Gradio interface.

The pipeline supports fine-tuning and inference with three interchangeable models: **Llama 3**, **Gemma**, and **Mistral**.

## Retrieval Architecture

The retrieval system uses 3 stages to maximize answer quality:

1. **FAISS semantic search** — encodes the query with `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` and retrieves the top-K semantically similar chunks
2. **BM25 keyword search** — runs a parallel keyword search to catch exact-match results that semantic search may miss
3. **CrossEncoder reranking** — combines and deduplicates both result sets, reranks with `ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, and passes the top 3 passages as LLM context

---

## Model
 
The pipeline supports three interchangeable models for fine-tuning and inference:

```bash
sbatch scripts/submit_axolotl_model.sh llama    # Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct
sbatch scripts/submit_axolotl_model.sh gemma    # Gemma
sbatch scripts/submit_axolotl_model.sh mistral  # Mistral (default)
```

| Component | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Supported LLMs | Llama 3 8B Instruct, Gemma, Mistral |
| Default model | Mistral |
| Fine-tuning method | QLoRA via Axolotl |
| Adapter path | `bot_test_resources/{MODEL NAME}/qlora-out/` |
| Embedding model | `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` |
| Reranker | `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2` |
| UI/Gradio | `{MODEL NAME}_bot.py` or `Google Collab Notebook` |

System prompt: *"You are a professional William & Mary Academic Advisor. Your sole purpose is to assists students with W&M-related inquiries. If a student asks a question that is unrelated to William & Mary, you must politely decline to answer and offer to help them with their academic journey instead. Do not provide general knowledge or instructions outside of this scope."*

---

## Data Sources

Our dataset was scraped from 14 sources spanning W&M's official web presence, affiliated institutions, and the surrounding Williamsburg community. This includes the main W&M site, course catalog, library, law school, Mason School of Business, CDSP, VIMS, and ScholarWorks, as well as campus life sources like the Flat Hat student newspaper, dining, and recreation. We also incorporated content from Colonial Williamsburg and Visit Williamsburg to provide broader local context.

Scraped content is organized by site under `data/raw/`:

| Source | Directory |
|--------|-----------|
| W&M main site | `wm_edu/` |
| Course catalog | `catalog/` |
| W&M news | `news/` |
| W&M library | `wm_library/` |
| Law school | `law/` |
| Flat Hat (student newspaper) | `flathat/` |
| Dining | `dininghub/` |
| Recreation | `rec/` |
| VIMS | `vims/` |
| Visit Williamsburg | `visit_wmburg/` |
| Mason School of Business | `mason/` |
| CDSP | `cdsp/` |
| Colonial Williamsburg | `cw/` |
| ScholarWorks | `scholarworks/` |

## How to Run

It is strongly encouraged to run the bot using the `bot_ui.ipynb` file in Google Collab, utilizing a T4 runtime. The weights and data have been uploaded to a Hugging Face Space and are accessible from there. All you have to do is put your Hugging Face read token in the Collab secrets as HF_TOKEN. 

If you want to run the process on your own data, continue on reading this section. The whole process may take up to **15 hours** and requires special access to the **Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct Model**. If you do not have access, you *must* run the bot through the script `bot_ui.ipynb`.

### HPC (SLURM)

```bash
# Set up all 3 environments
bash 00_pipeline_envs.sh

# Scraping (takes metadata from data/metadata/metadata.csv)
sbatch 00_pipeline_scraping.sh

# Cleaning/formatting (run stages together)
sbatch 01_pipeline_cleaning.sh  # runs scripts 02–06

# Fine-tuning
sbatch 02_pipeline_tuning.sh

# Training via axolotl
sbatch 03_pipeline_axolotl.sh

# Launch chatbot interactively, replace {MODEL NAME} with model option of choice (gemma, llama, mistral). Mistral is the only model that does not require special access.

srun -p batch --gres=gpu:1 --mem=64G -t 01:00:00 --pty bash

# When connected to a node

## Demo & Results

### Example Chatbot Outputs

| User Query | Bot Response |
|------------|--------------|
| *"What majors are in arts & sciences?"* | *"At William & Mary, the Arts & Sciences majors include but are not limited to: Anthropology, Biology, Chemistry, Classical Studies, Computer Science, Economics, English, Environmental Science, Geology, History, Mathematics, Physics, Psychology, Sociology, and Theatre, Speech, and Dance. However, this is not an exhaustive list. I would recommend visiting the W&M website or contacting the appropriate department or faculty member for more information on majors in Arts & Sciences."* |
| *"What resources can I use at the Swem Library?"* | *"The Swem Library offers a variety of resources to help you with your academic journey. You can access databases, e-books, journals, and newspapers, as well as physical books, DVDs, and more. Additionally, the library has a number of study spaces, including individual study rooms, group study rooms, and quiet study areas. You can also visit the library's website to see what events are happening, such as workshops and lectures. For more information, you can visit the library's website or speak with a librarian."* |
| *"What degrees can I pursue at the Business School at W&M?"* | *"The Business School, also known as the Raymond A. Mason School of Business, offers undergraduate degrees in Business Administration. Specifically, you can pursue a Business Administration degree with majors in Accounting, Business Analytics, Business Management, Economics, Entrepreneurship, International Business, Marketing, and Real Estate. Additionally, the Business School offers a joint degree program with the School of Law, which allows students to earn both a Juris Doctor (J.D.) and a Master of Business Administration (M.B.A.) in approximately six years. For more information, I recommend visiting the Business School's website or reaching out to an academic advisor."* |

### Evaluation 

We evaluated the chatbot on retrieval quality, answer relevance, and overall system performance using representative William & Mary queries across academics, campus resources, dining, libraries, and administrative topics.

#### Key Findings
- The **hybrid retrieval pipeline** (FAISS + BM25 + CrossEncoder reranking) improved retrieval accuracy compared to using semantic or keyword search alone
- **CrossEncoder reranking** improved precision by selecting the most relevant passages before generation
- **QLoRA fine-tuning** improved response quality, domain specificity, and formatting for W&M-related questions
- The chatbot successfully generated grounded responses for a wide range of campus-related queries through the Gradio interface
#### Future Improvements
- Add automated retrieval metrics such as Recall\@K and MRR
- Expand the scraped dataset coverage
- Conduct structured user testing and evaluation


### User Interface 

Below is the gradio interface that can be run through the .ipynb

## Known Limitations
- Scraping is scoped to selected W&M sites; not a full site crawl
- Conda environment and package versions are highly specific. We have provided a few methods for setting up environments, and package versions are listed in the yaml/txt files in the envs folder
- Missing or incomplete scraped data occasionally produced vague or generic responses
- Ambiguous queries reduced retrieval quality and answer precision
- Benchmarking and automated evaluation metrics are still under development
